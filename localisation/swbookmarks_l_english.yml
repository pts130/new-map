 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Clone Wars"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Clone Wars (22-19 BBY), occasionally referred to as the Clone War, the Separatist War, or the Droid War, was the name given to the major, three-year galactic war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The war is named after the clone troopers used by the Republic against the Confederacy's battle droids."
 REP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The balance of power in the galaxy sits on a razor's edge. Years of weak and ineffectual rulership have decayed a once powerful galactic institituion. The Senate has become divided between those who genuinely wished to uphold the values and ideals of the Republic, and those who wished to further their own goals. Rumblings among the constituents of the Republic indicate a growing separatist movement that threatens to tear the galaxy apart. Can the republic reform and stop a total collapse of the galactic power structure? Or will a great war come and end this great era of peace?"
 CIS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new hope emerges! Under the stewardship of Count Dooku and the mighty trade federation - a new confederacy has formed for those finished with the corruption and terror of an old and decrepid republic. Long live the Confederacy!"
 HUT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Never has there been a greater moment for the people of Nal Hutta. After years of languish under a tryanical Republican rule, the great Hutt Empire has been returned to it's rightful stature in the galaxy. The Hutt Council has served them well, and now with war on the horizon the Hutts must squeeze the Republic and Conferdacy for all credits possible. Long live Nal Hutta!"
