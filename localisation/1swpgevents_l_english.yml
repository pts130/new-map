swpg.1.desc:0 "A convoy of peaceful Trade Federation vessels carrying vast amount of Iommite Ore, and a small shipment of extremely valuable Aurodium have been attacked by organised pirates in the Dorvalla system. Estimated to have a value of over 60,000 credits, Viceroy Nute Gungray made an impassioned speech earlier this morning on reforms believed necessary to prevent another attack. Nemodia has made nenewed calls for the relaxing of weapons restrictions imposed by the Russan reformation, as well as an introduction of trade route taxation in the outer rim systems to halt the spread of these pirates. These demands will be heard on the senate floor later this week, in which Chancellor Valorum will comment on the issue."

swpg.2.desc:0 "A trade dispute between the galactic trade federation and the Naboo government has culminated in a full-blown blockade of the planet. In a show of weakness for a collapsing Valorum government, the Republic has neglected to dispatch a peacemaker force. Calls have rung throughout the senate for an impromptu election for the position of chancellor, and it'll later come to be in the upcoming months."
